# Jenkins-Pipeline-Examples
A repository for hosting the code samples used for the Jenkins presentation.

In the current repository I propose to upload most of the source code that I have used for the presentation concerning the world of CI/CD tools and in particular the Jenkins automation server. 

The uploaded piepline descriptions are all examples of how a Jenkins pipeline can be structured - regardless of the scripted or declarative pipeline model.

Please follow the recommendations listed inside each Jenkinsfile in order to accordingly adjust the given pipeline scripts before attempting to use them in your own environment.

It is recommended to create separate Jenkins pipelines in order to test the given scripts - just adjust there the paths to the Jenkinsfile that you wish to use.

In particular, for the last added example, be sure to fork the repository located at https://github.com/monodot/pipeline-library-demo before using the pipeline in question - apart from this, the same usage rules described before apply to this part as well.

The current repository bears MIT license - it is thus free for usage and distribution.
